# GitBridge Performance Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the performance testing strategy for the GitBridge project, focusing on ensuring the system meets its performance requirements under various conditions.

## Performance Test Categories

### 1. Load Testing (`test_load.py`)
- Tests system behavior under normal to heavy load
- Validates task chain processing performance
- Ensures concurrent operations work correctly
- Target: Process 1,000 tasks within 5 seconds

### 2. Stress Testing (`test_stress.py`)
- Tests system behavior under extreme conditions
- Validates resource limit handling
- Ensures graceful degradation
- Memory usage monitoring
- CPU utilization tracking

### 3. Benchmarking (`test_benchmark.py`)
- Measures key operation performance
- Validates timing requirements
- Tracks performance metrics
- Target: <100ms per task delegation

## Test Configuration

### Resource Limits
- Memory: 1000MB max
- File descriptors: 1024 max
- CPU time: 30 seconds per test

### Test Environment
- Automatic cleanup of test artifacts
- Resource monitoring during tests
- Skip tests if system resources are constrained

## Running Performance Tests

```bash
# Install test dependencies
pip install -r requirements-test.txt

# Run all performance tests
pytest tests/performance/

# Run specific test categories
pytest tests/performance/test_load.py
pytest tests/performance/test_stress.py
pytest tests/performance/test_benchmark.py

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=. tests/performance/
```

## Performance Metrics

### Task Chain Processing
- Generation: <10ms per task
- Processing: <5s for 1000 tasks
- Summarization: <1s for chain

### I/O Operations
- Write: <500ms average
- Read: <100ms average
- Concurrent operations: <2s for 20 updates

### Resource Usage
- Memory: <100MB increase under load
- CPU: Efficient utilization
- File handles: Proper cleanup

## Continuous Integration

Performance tests are integrated into the CI pipeline with:
- Automatic test execution
- Performance regression detection
- Resource usage monitoring
- Test result reporting

## Best Practices

1. **Clean State**
   - Each test starts with a clean environment
   - All resources are properly cleaned up
   - Temporary files are removed

2. **Resource Management**
   - Monitor system resources
   - Skip tests if resources are constrained
   - Restore original limits after tests

3. **Metrics Collection**
   - Track key performance indicators
   - Monitor resource usage
   - Record timing information

4. **Test Independence**
   - Tests can run independently
   - No shared state between tests
   - Proper isolation of test data

## Future Enhancements

1. **Extended Metrics**
   - Network latency monitoring
   - Database performance tracking
   - Cache hit/miss ratios

2. **Load Patterns**
   - Variable load scenarios
   - Peak load testing
   - Recovery testing

3. **Integration Tests**
   - End-to-end performance
   - Cross-component timing
   - System-wide metrics
