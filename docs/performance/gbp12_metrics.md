- Implementation complexity: Medium
- Risk level: Low

### GBP14 (Enhanced Metadata)
- Expected latency impact: +2-3ms
- Optimization potential: High
- Risk level: Low

### GBP17 (Rate Limiting)
- Expected latency overhead: 1-2ms
- Benefit: Improved stability
- Risk level: Low

### GBP24 (Sub-350ms Target)
- Current gap: 37.2ms
- Required improvements: 3
- Risk level: Medium

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Implement Redis queue (GBP13)
   - Optimize consensus processing
   - Add memory caching

2. **Monitoring Enhancements**
   - Add detailed latency breakdowns
   - Implement trace sampling
   - Set up automated alerts

3. **Future Planning**
   - Design for sub-350ms target
   - Plan Redis cluster scaling
   - Prepare for increased load

## Conclusion

The GBP12 implementation successfully meets the current latency target of <600ms with an average end-to-end latency of 312.8ms. The system is well-positioned for future optimizations and enhancements in GBP13-30.
