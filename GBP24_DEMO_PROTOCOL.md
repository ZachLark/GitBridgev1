## 👤 4. Instructions for Human Tester (Lukas)

### Welcome Message
> **"Hi Lukas! Welcome to GitBridge Phase 24. You're about to witness something special - a live demonstration of our multi-agent collaboration system. Watch as three AI agents work together on a coding task, with every action tracked, attributed, and visualized in real-time. This isn't just coding - it's the future of collaborative development."**

### What to Expect
1. **The Setup (30 seconds):** Watch the dashboard load with initial data
2. **Collaboration Begins (2 minutes):** See agents register and start working
3. **Real-time Activity (3 minutes):** Observe live file modifications and reviews
4. **Attribution Tracking (2 minutes):** Explore who did what and when
5. **Diff Visualization (1 minute):** See the actual code changes
6. **Export & Analysis (1 minute):** Generate collaboration reports

### Interactive Opportunities
- **Ask Questions:** "How does the system know which agent made which change?"
- **Request Demonstrations:** "Can you show me what happens if an AI agent fails?"
- **Explore Features:** "Let's look at the detailed attribution for this task"
- **Test Scenarios:** "What if we add a fourth agent to the collaboration?"

### Key Points to Highlight
