## Suggestion
This pull request looks good overall, but I have a few suggestions for improvement:

**Security Considerations:**
1. Add input validation to the JWT token handler
2. Implement proper token expiration checks
3. Add rate limiting for authentication endpoints

**Code Quality:**
1. Consider adding more comprehensive error handling
2. The test coverage could be expanded to include edge cases
3. Documentation is well written and clear

**Recommendations:**
- Implement the security improvements before merging
- Add integration tests for the authentication flow
- Consider adding logging for security events
