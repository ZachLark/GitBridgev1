Phase 6 Revised Working Schedule: Task Delegation with Cursor AI for GitBridge Project  
Generated on: 05:55 PM PDT, Saturday, May 31, 2025  

Overview  
Phase 6 (GBP6) enables task delegation for MAS Light within GitBridge, allowing Grok and ChatGPT to share Atlas PALM v1.5 tasks (e.g., drafting Developer Guide sections). It builds on Phase 5’s Flask API (agent_api.py), live on Render (https://erudite-ecb-api.onrender.com) with Swagger documentation (/apidocs), to create mas_delegate.py. This script parses task templates, delegates tasks via API calls, logs details, and generates documentation, per MAS Lite Protocol v2.1 (Sections III.1, V). The revised schedule leverages Cursor AI’s advanced features—Composer, Agent Mode with YOLO, inline edits, automated testing, and innovative strategies—to reduce the original 12–14 hours to ~4–5.5 hours. A 45-minute pre-GBP6 setup configures .cursorrules and TraycerAI for consistency and planning.

Pre-GBP6 Setup: Configure Cursor AI Tools  
Description/Purpose: Set up .cursorrules and TraycerAI to ensure Cursor AI outputs align with GitBridge’s standards (Python 3.13.3, Pylint compliance, MAS Lite Protocol v2.1) and generate task-specific plans, enhancing efficiency and accuracy.  
Tasks:  
- Pre-GBP6S1: Create .cursorrules File (15 min)  
  - Pre-GBP6S1T1: Prompt Cursor: “Generate a .cursorrules file for GitBridge with rules: use Python 3.13.3, adhere to Pylint (max-line-length=88, enable docstrings), use hashlib for SHA256, include MAS Lite Protocol v2.1 comments, prefer requests for API calls.” Save in project root.  
- Pre-GBP6S2: Install and Configure TraycerAI (30 min)  
  - Pre-GBP6S2T1: Install TraycerAI via Cursor’s extension marketplace.  
  - Pre-GBP6S2T2: Configure TraycerAI to monitor https://github.com/ZachLark/erudite-ecb-api and generate a task plan for GBP6P2. Prompt: “Use TraycerAI to create a task plan for mas_delegate.py development, covering parsing, API calls, logging, and testing.”  
Estimated Time: 45 minutes  
Scheduled: May 31, 2025, 05:55 PM–06:40 PM PDT  

GBP6P1: Define Task Template (task_template.json)  
Description/Purpose: Create task_template.json with fields: task_id (SHA256-validated), description, assignee, max_cycles (default: 10), token_budget (default: 5000). Use Composer for schema generation and Agent Mode for SHA validation, per MAS Lite Protocol v2.1 (Section III.1). Incorporate dynamic prompt templating by saving a reusable prompt.  
Tasks:  
- GBP6P1S1: Design Template Structure (10 min)  
  - GBP6P1S1T1: Use Composer: “Generate a JSON schema for task_template.json with fields task_id (SHA256-validated), description, assignee, max_cycles (default: 10), token_budget (default: 5000), per MAS Lite Protocol v2.1 Section III.1. Include example values and ensure valid JSON syntax.” Save as a prompt template: “Generate [DELIVERABLE] for GitBridge using [LANGUAGE] with [SPECIFICATIONS].”  
- GBP6P1S2: Implement SHA Validation (20 min)  
  - GBP6P1S2T1: Use Agent Mode: “Write a Python function using hashlib to generate a SHA256 task_id from description + timestamp, ensuring format ‘SHA256:<64-char-hash>’. Validate in task_template.json, raising errors for invalid formats.”  
Estimated Time: 30 minutes  
Scheduled: May 31, 2025, 06:40 PM–07:10 PM PDT  

GBP6P2: Update agent_api.py and Generate Documentation  
Description/Purpose: Update agent_api.py’s /collaborate endpoint to parse max_cycles and token_budget, update Swagger, and generate a Developer Guide section using automated documentation. Use inline edits and Composer, per Protocol v2.1 (Section III.1).  
Tasks:  
- GBP6P2S1: Modify /collaborate Endpoint (15 min)  
  - GBP6P2S1T1: Select /collaborate code, use Cmd + K: “Add parsing for max_cycles and token_budget in POST payload, update logging to include these fields, ensure compatibility with mas_delegate.py.”  
- GBP6P2S2: Update Swagger and Generate Documentation (15 min)  
  - GBP6P2S2T1: Use Composer: “Update Swagger schema for /collaborate in agent_api.py to include max_cycles and token_budget. Generate a Developer Guide section documenting the endpoint updates, per MAS Lite Protocol v2.1 Section V.”

  - GBP6P3S1T1: Use Agent Mode: “Write a function to load and parse task_template.json, validating fields (task_id with SHA256, description, assignee, max_cycles, token_budget). Run bug finder to catch JSON parsing errors.” Use TraycerAI’s plan for structure.  
- GBP6P3S2: Implement API Call (30 min)  
  - GBP6P3S2T1: Prompt: “Add requests.post to send task details to /collaborate, handle responses, and log success/errors. Use bug finder to prevent API failures.”  
- GBP6P3S3: Implement Task Logging (30 min)  
  - GBP6P3S3T1: Prompt: “Define log format (task_id, assignee, timestamp, max_cycles, token_budget, cycle_count) and append to task_log.json, handling file write errors.”
