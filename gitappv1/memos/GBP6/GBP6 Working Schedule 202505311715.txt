Phase 6 Working Schedule: Task Delegation with Cursor AI for GitBridge Project  
Generated on: 05:15 PM PDT, Saturday, May 31, 2025  

Overview:  
Phase 6 (GBP6) of the 20-Phase Master Plan enables task delegation for MAS Light within GitBridge, allowing Grok and ChatGPT to share Atlas PALM v1.5 tasks (e.g., drafting Developer Guide sections). It builds on Phase 5’s Flask API (agent_api.py), live on Render (https://erudite-ecb-api.onrender.com) with Swagger documentation (/apidocs), to create mas_delegate.py. This script parses task templates, delegates tasks via API calls, and logs details, aligning with MAS Lite Protocol v2.1 (Sections III.1, V). Phase 6 consists of 7 Parts (GBP6P1–GBP6P7), starting after Phase 5 completion (May 31, 2025, 04:47 PM PDT).  

GBP6P1: Define Task Template (task_template.json)  
Description/Purpose: Create a JSON task template defining fields: task_id (SHA-validated), description (e.g., “Draft Developer Guide Section 3”), assignee (e.g., “ChatGPT”), max_cycles (default 10), and token_budget (e.g., 5000 tokens). This standardizes task assignments for MAS Light, ensuring consistent processing with resource constraints, per MAS Lite Protocol v2.1 (Section III.1).  
GBP6P1S1: Design Template Structure  
- GBP6P1S1T1: Draft JSON schema with fields: task_id, description, assignee, max_cycles, token_budget. (15 min)  
- GBP6P1S1T2: Define default values (e.g., max_cycles: 10, token_budget: 5000). (15 min)  
GBP6P1S2: Implement SHA Validation for task_id  
- GBP6P1S2T1: Use Python’s hashlib to generate SHA256 for task_id. (30 min)  
- GBP6P1S2T2: Validate task_id format in JSON. (30 min)  
Estimated Time: 1.5 hours  
Scheduled: May 31, 2025, 05:15 PM–06:45 PM PDT  

GBP6P2: Update agent_api.py to Handle New Fields  
Description/Purpose: Update agent_api.py’s /collaborate endpoint to parse max_cycles and token_budget from the POST request payload, ensuring compatibility with mas_delegate.py’s API calls, per Protocol v2.1 (Section III.1).  
GBP6P2S1: Modify /collaborate Endpoint  
- GBP6P2S1T1: Add parsing for max_cycles and token_budget in agent_api.py. (30 min)  
- GBP6P2S1T2: Update logging to include new fields. (15 min)  
GBP6P2S2: Update Swagger Documentation  
- GBP6P2S2T1: Add max_cycles and token_budget to Swagger schema for /collaborate. (15 min)  
Estimated Time: 1 hour  
Scheduled: May 31, 2025, 06:45 PM–07:45 PM PDT  

GBP6P3: Develop mas_delegate.py with Parsing, API Call, and Logging  
Description/Purpose: Create mas_delegate.py to parse task_template.json, send task details to /collaborate, and log results to task_log.json, combining parsing (GBP6P2), API call (GBP6P3), and logging (GBP6P4) into a cohesive implementation, per Protocol v2.1 (Sections III.1–III.2, V).  
GBP6P3S1: Parse Task Template  
- GBP6P3S1T1: Write function to load and parse task_template.json. (45 min)

GBP6P3S2: Implement API Call  
- GBP6P3S2T1: Add requests.post to send task details to /collaborate. (45 min)  
- GBP6P3S2T2: Handle API response, logging success or errors. (30 min)  
GBP6P3S3: Implement Task Logging  
- GBP6P3S3T1: Define log format (task_id, assignee, timestamp, max_cycles, token_budget, cycle count). (30 min)  
- GBP6P3S3T2: Write code to append to task_log.json, handling file write errors. (45 min)  
GBP6P3S4: Unit Test Workflow  
- GBP6P3S4T1: Test parsing, API call, and logging together with a sample task. (30 min)  
- GBP6P3S4T2: Debug any immediate errors (e.g., JSON parsing, API failures). (30 min)

Scheduled: May 31, 2025, 07:45 PM–Jun 1, 2025, 12:45 AM PDT  

GBP6P4: Test Delegation with Sample Task  
Description/Purpose: Test mas_delegate.py by delegating a sample task (e.g., “Draft Developer Guide Section 3” to ChatGPT) via /collaborate, verifying API response, task_log.json entries, and UI feedback (e.g., “Task Assigned to ChatGPT, Task ID: SHA256:abc123”), per Protocol v2.1 (Section VI.1).  
GBP6P4S1: Prepare Sample Task  
- GBP6P4S1T1: Create sample task in task_template.json (description: “Draft Developer Guide Section 3”, assignee: “ChatGPT”). (30 min)
