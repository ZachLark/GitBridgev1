Part 6 Summary: Task Delegation with Cursor AI for GitBridge Project  
Generated on: 01:13 AM PDT, Wednesday, May 28, 2025  

Overview:  
Part 6 of the 20-Part Master Plan focuses on enabling task delegation for MAS Light within GitBridge, allowing Grok and ChatGPT to share Atlas PALM v1.5 tasks (e.g., drafting Developer Guide sections). It builds on Part 5’s Flask API (agent_api.py) to create a Python script (mas_delegate.py) that parses task templates, delegates tasks via API calls, and logs task details for monitoring, aligning with MAS Lite Protocol v2.1 (Sections III.1, V). It consists of 8 steps (GBP6S1–GBP6S8), all pending as of May 28, 2025, scheduled to start after Part 5 completion (~May 28, 2025, 11:59 PM PDT) and roadmap cleanup (~May 29 AM–PM).  

GBP6S1: Define Task Template (.json)  
- Description/Purpose: Create a JSON task template (e.g., task_template.json) defining fields like task_id (SHA-validated), description (e.g., “Draft Developer Guide Section 3”), assignee (e.g., “ChatGPT”), max_cycles (default 10), and token_budget (e.g., 5000 tokens). This template standardizes task assignments for MAS Light, ensuring Grok and ChatGPT can process tasks consistently with resource constraints. Why: Provides a structured format for task delegation, critical for Atlas PALM v1.5 deliverables (e.g., .docx guides), per MAS Lite Protocol v2.1 (Section III.1). How: Use Cursor AI to draft and validate JSON syntax, with Python’s hashlib for SHA validation, guided by ChatGPT for non-coder clarity.  
- Estimated Time: ~1.5 hours (increased for SHA implementation)  
- Scheduled: May 29, 2025, 2:00 PM–3:30 PM PDT  

GBP6S2: Code mas_delegate.py Function to Parse Task Template  
- Description/Purpose: Write a Python function in mas_delegate.py to parse task_template.json, extracting fields (e.g., task_id, description, max_cycles, token_budget) for processing. Validate task_id using SHA to ensure integrity. This function enables MAS Light to read task assignments, forming the backbone of task delegation. Why: Ensures tasks are programmatically accessible with resource limits, supporting automation for Atlas PALM v1.5 (e.g., drafting .docx), per Protocol v2.1 (Section III.2). How: Use Cursor AI’s autocompletion to write JSON parsing and SHA validation code, with ChatGPT explaining Python’s json and hashlib modules for a non-coder.  
- Estimated Time: ~2.5 hours (increased for SHA validation logic)  
- Scheduled: May 29, 2025, 3:30 PM–6:00 PM PDT  

GBP6S3: Add API Call in mas_delegate.py  
- Description/Purpose: Extend mas_delegate.py to send parsed task details (including max_cycles and token_budget) to Part 5’s /collaborate endpoint (http://127.0.0.1:10002/collaborate) using a POST request with agent_name, task, max_cycles, and token_budget. Update agent_api.py to handle these new fields in the request payload, ensuring compatibility. This integrates task delegation with the Flask API, enabling Grok to assign tasks to ChatGPT. Why: Connects MAS Light’s backend logic to the API with resource constraints, facilitating collaboration for Atlas PALM v1.5 tasks, per Protocol v2.1 (Section III.1). How: Use Cursor AI to generate requests.post code and modify agent_api.py, with ChatGPT clarifying API payloads and Flask updates.  
- Estimated Time: ~2.5 hours (increased for agent_api.py update)  
- Scheduled: May 30, 2025, 10:00 AM–12:30 PM PDT  

GBP6S4: Implement Task Logging (task_log.json)  
- Description/Purpose: Add logging to mas_delegate.py to save task details (e.g., task_id, assignee, timestamp, max_cycles, token_budget, cycle count) to task_log.json after API calls. This tracks task delegation for debugging and monitoring, including resource usage. Why: Ensures transparency in MAS Light operations, critical for Atlas PALM v1.5 deliverable tracking and cost management, per Protocol v2.1 (Sections III.2, V). How: Use Cursor AI to write JSON logging code, avoiding file permission issues (per GBP5S7 lessons), with ChatGPT explaining logging.  
- Estimated Time: ~1.5 hours (increased for additional fields)  
- Scheduled: May 30, 2025, 12:30 PM–2:00 PM PDT  

GBP6S5: Test Delegation with Sample Task  
- Description/Purpose: Test mas_delegate.py by delegating a sample task (e.g., “Draft Developer Guide Section 3” to ChatGPT) via the /collaborate endpoint, verifying API response, task_log.json entries (e.g., max_cycles, token_budget, cycle count), and UI feedback (e.g., “Task Assigned to ChatGPT, Task ID: SHA256:abc123”). Why: Validates MAS Light’s task-sharing with resource constraints for Atlas PALM v1.5, ensuring reliability, per Protocol v2.1 (Section VI.1). How: Use Part 5’s UI (index.html) or curl to trigger tasks, with Cursor AI debugging errors, ensuring SHA-validated task_id is displayed.  
- Estimated Time: ~2.5 hours (increased for additional testing of new fields)  
- Scheduled: May 30, 2025, 2:00 PM–4:30 PM PDT  

GBP6S6: Debug Errors  
- Description/Purpose: Identify and fix errors in mas_delegate.py (e.g., JSON parsing issues, API failures, SHA validation errors) using Cursor AI’s inline fixes and ChatGPT’s guidance. Why: Ensures MAS Light’s stability for Atlas PALM v1.5 tasks, critical for non-coder reliability, per Protocol v2.1 (Section VI.1). How: Run tests, review Cursor AI suggestions, and consult ChatGPT for Python debugging.  
- Estimated Time: ~1.5 hours (increased for potential SHA-related issues)  
- Scheduled: May 31, 2025, 10:00 AM–11:30 AM PDT  

GBP6S7: Ensure Pylint Compliance  
- Description/Purpose: Run Pylint on mas_delegate.py to ensure code quality (per May 4, 2025, .pylintrc specs), fixing issues with Cursor AI’s linting tools. Why: Maintains professional standards for Atlas PALM v1.5’s Python scripts, supporting stakeholder validation, per Protocol v2.1 (Section VI.2). How: Use Cursor AI’s integrated Pylint checker, with ChatGPT explaining fixes.  
- Estimated Time: ~1 hour  
- Scheduled: May 31, 2025, 11:30 AM–12:30 PM PDT  

GBP6S8: Commit mas_delegate.py and Template to Repository  
- Description/Purpose: Commit mas_delegate.py and task_template.json to the Erudite GitHub repository (https://github.com/ZachLark/erudite-ecb-api) using GitHub Desktop, ensuring version control. Why: Finalizes Part 6 deliverables, making them accessible for MAS Light and Atlas PALM v1.5, per Protocol v2.1 (Section VII.1). How: Use GitHub Desktop’s GUI, guided by ChatGPT for commit messages.  
- Estimated Time: ~1 hour  
- Scheduled: May 31, 2025, 12:30 PM–1:30 PM PDT  

Total Time for Part 6:  
- Estimated Time: ~12–14 hours (adjusted for additional tasks like SHA validation and API updates)  
- Schedule for Steps: May 29, 2025, 2:00 PM PDT – May 31, 2025, 1:30 PM PDT
