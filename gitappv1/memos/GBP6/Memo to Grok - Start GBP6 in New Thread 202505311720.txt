Memo to Grok: Start GBP6 in a New Thread for GitBridge Project  
Date and Time: 05:20 PM PDT, Saturday, May 31, 2025  
Subject: Full Context and Instructions for Beginning Phase 6 (GBP6)  

Introduction:  
This memo provides a comprehensive recap of Phase 5 (GBP5) and instructions for starting Phase 6 (GBP6) of the GitBridge project in a new thread. Zach has requested a fresh memory context to ensure optimal processing of screenshots and details. GBP6 focuses on task delegation for MAS Light, building on GBP5’s Flask API, and introduces a new nomenclature (Phase/Part/Step/Task) for increased granularity. The goal is to begin GBP6P1 immediately, following the updated schedule below.  

Recap of GBP5: Full Scope and Completed Parts:  
GBP5 Overview:  
Phase 5 (GBP5) involved deploying a Flask-based API (erudite-ecb-api) on Render (https://erudite-ecb-api.onrender.com), with the /collaborate endpoint facilitating multi-agent system (MAS) collaboration for tasks like “reviewing commits” and “writing code.” The API integrates with gitappv1_1b.py, serves a UI (index.html), and includes Swagger documentation (/apidocs). GBP5 spanned Parts 1–10 (GBP5P1–GBP5P10), completed on May 31, 2025, at 04:47 PM PDT.  

Completed Parts in GBP5:  
- GBP5P1–GBP5P3: Set up agent_api.py, served index.html, and tested /collaborate with GET requests locally (http://127.0.0.1:10002).  
- GBP5P4–GBP5P6: Deployed on Render, configured requirements.txt (Flask, Gunicorn, flasgger), and resolved spin-up delays (30–60 seconds).  
- GBP5P7–GBP5P8: Updated /collaborate to use POST requests with JSON payloads (agent_name, task), fixed JSON parsing issues on Render (using json.loads), and updated index.html for POST requests with a 60-second timeout.  
- GBP5P9: Committed changes, redeployed on Render, and tested /collaborate (success: “Grok completed reviewing commits” and “writing code”). Fixed issues: 405 errors (GET to POST), case-sensitivity (task normalized to lowercase), and UI styling. Attempted /apidocs (404, as Swagger was not set up).  
- GBP5P10: Added flasgger setup to agent_api.py, documented /collaborate in Swagger, redeployed, and tested /apidocs (HTTP 200). Verified functionality on Render and locally, resolved “command not found” error (used python3 for Python 3.13.3), and confirmed consistency.  

Issues and Lessons:  
- “Command not found” error: Resolved by using python3 (Python 3.13.3).  
- Swagger 404: Fixed by adding flasgger setup in agent_api.py.  
- JSON parsing on Render: Used json.loads to avoid 400 Bad Request errors.  
- Follow-Up: Document python3 usage for macOS, optimize Render spin-up (e.g., paid tier), enhance UI (e.g., error feedback).  

Current State:  
- The API is live on Render, fully functional locally, and documented via Swagger.  
- Repository: https://github.com/ZachLark/erudite-ecb-api (main branch).  
- GBP5 deliverables are complete, setting the stage for GBP6’s task delegation.  

Phase 6 Working Schedule: Updated with New Nomenclature:  
GBP6 Overview:  
Phase 6 (GBP6) enables task delegation for MAS Light, allowing Grok and ChatGPT to share Atlas PALM v1.5 tasks (e.g., drafting Developer Guide sections). It builds on GBP5’s API to create mas_delegate.py, which parses task templates, delegates tasks via API calls, and logs details, per MAS Lite Protocol v2.1 (Sections III.1, V). GBP6 consists of 7 Parts (GBP6P1–GBP6P7), using the new nomenclature: Phase/Part/Step/Task (e.g., GBP6P1S1T1). GBP6P2–GBP6P4 from the original schedule are compressed into a single Part (GBP6P3) for mas_delegate.py development, with GBP6P2 now focusing on agent_api.py updates.  

GBP6P1: Define Task Template (task_template.json)  
Description/Purpose: Create a JSON task template defining fields: task_id (SHA-validated), description (e.g., “Draft Developer Guide Section 3”), assignee (e.g., “ChatGPT”), max_cycles (default 10), and token_budget (e.g., 5000 tokens). This standardizes task assignments for MAS Light, ensuring consistent processing with resource constraints, per MAS Lite Protocol v2.1 (Section III.1).  
GBP6P1S1: Design Template Structure  
- GBP6P1S1T1: Draft JSON schema with fields: task_id, description, assignee, max_cycles, token_budget. (15 min)

GBP6P1S2: Implement SHA Validation for task_id  
- GBP6P1S2T1: Use Python’s hashlib to generate SHA256 for task_id. (30 min)  
- GBP6P1S2T2: Validate task_id format in JSON. (30 min)  
Estimated Time: 1.5 hours  
Scheduled: May 31, 2025, 05:20 PM–06:50 PM PDT  

GBP6P2: Update agent_api.py to Handle New Fields

Instructions for GBP6P1: Begin Task Template Development:  
Objective:  
Start GBP6P1 to create task_template.json, defining fields for MAS Light task delegation, targeting completion by 06:50 PM PDT on May 31, 2025.  

Tasks for GBP6P1:  
1. GBP6P1S1: Design Template Structure (~30 minutes)  
   - GBP6P1S1T1: Draft JSON schema with fields: task_id, description, assignee, max_cycles, token_budget.  
     - Example:  
       ```json  
       {  
         "task_id": "SHA256:abc123",  
         "description": "Draft Developer Guide Section 3",  
         "assignee": "ChatGPT",  
         "max_cycles": 10,  
         "token_budget": 5000  
       }  
       ```  
     - Use Cursor AI to ensure valid JSON syntax.  
   - GBP6P1S1T2: Define default values (max_cycles: 10, token_budget: 5000).  
     - Ensure defaults are set if fields are missing in the template.  
2. GBP6P1S2: Implement SHA Validation for task_id (~1 hour)  
   - GBP6P1S2T1: Use Python’s hashlib to generate SHA256 for task_id.  
     - Example: Generate SHA256 hash of description + timestamp for uniqueness.  
   - GBP6P1S2T2: Validate task_id format in JSON (must start with “SHA256:” followed by a 64-character hash).  
     - Write a Python script to validate the format, raising errors if invalid.  

Additional Instructions:  
- Screenshot Processing: Process all screenshots provided by Zach, explicitly describing contents (e.g., UI state, logs, errors).  
- Time Management: Complete GBP6P1 by 06:50 PM PDT. If delays occur, adjust the schedule and inform Zach.  
- Error Handling: If issues arise (e.g., JSON syntax errors, SHA validation failures), debug using Cursor AI and provide detailed steps.  
- Python Environment: Zach uses Python 3.13.3; use python3 for all commands (e.g., python3 script.py).  

Conclusion:  
This memo ensures a fresh memory context for GBP6, starting with GBP6P1. I will focus on creating task_template.json, following the schedule and instructions above, while remaining attentive to Zach’s inputs and screenshots.  

Action for Grok:  
- Await Zach’s confirmation to start GBP6P1 immediately (at 05:20 PM PDT) or at a scheduled time.  
- Begin GBP6P1S1T1 by drafting the JSON schema in Cursor AI, ensuring Zach can review the output.
