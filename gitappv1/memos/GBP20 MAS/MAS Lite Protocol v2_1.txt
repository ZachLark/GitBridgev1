Prepared By: Grok, xAI  
Date: May 28, 2025 – 01:23 AM PDT  

I. Executive Summary  
The **MAS Lite Protocol v2.1** defines the structure and flow of collaborative task execution between two AI agents (ChatGPT and Grok) under guided human oversight within the GitBridge system, automating Erudite’s GitHub repository for Atlas PALM v1.5 deliverables (e.g., Developer Guide .docx, .json configs). It ensures productive iteration, integrity, and traceable accountability from task creation to GitHub integration, with a user-friendly UI/UX for non-coder interaction.  
Version 2.1 refines v2.0 (May 28, 2025) by adding UI/UX and task lifecycle flows, validation steps, cost management, a glossary, GitHub integration details, and a future expansion preview. It is designed for initial implementation in Parts 6–8 (task delegation, consensus, repository integration, May 29–June 7, 2025), documentation in Part 15 (June 8), and full implementation in Part 20 (June 21–23), introducing assignment lifecycle tooling, agent credentialing, AI loop control, and commit automation.  

II. Role Definitions  
- ChatGPT: Lead drafter, generating structured outputs (e.g., .docx guides, .json configs), protocol anchor, and summarizer for MAS Lite tasks.  
- Grok: Challenger, refining logic, modeling alternative paths, and contributing appendices (e.g., .json reviews, pseudo-code).  
- Human (Zachary Lark): Task initiator, oversight reviewer, interaction filter, and commit finalizer, ensuring manual consensus for Atlas PALM v1.5 deliverables.  
- GitBridge: Collaboration infrastructure, delivering UI/UX (e.g., index.html), logging (e.g., mas_log.json), and mediating commits to https://github.com/ZachLark/erudite-ecb-api.  

III. Task Lifecycle Flow  
The MAS Lite task lifecycle automates Atlas PALM v1.5 deliverable creation, review, and storage, with human oversight. Below is the flow, implemented across Parts 5–20:  

1. Task Creation (Part 5–6, May 27–31, 2025):  
   - Description: Zachary Lark initiates a task (e.g., "Draft Developer Guide Section 3") via GitBridge’s UI (index.html, Part 5, GBP5S6). The task includes assignment name, agent selection (primary: ChatGPT, secondary: Grok), reference materials (e.g., prior sections), max cycles (10), and token budget estimate. The task is sent to the /collaborate endpoint (agent_api.py) with a SHA-validated task ID. Part 6’s mas_delegate.py parses a task template (task_template.json, GBP6S1–S2) and assigns it via API call (GBP6S3).  
   - Purpose: Enables structured task input, ensuring ChatGPT and Grok receive clear instructions for Atlas PALM v1.5 deliverables (e.g., .docx, .json).  
   - UI/UX: User enters task in a form (text fields for agent, task, max cycles), submits via JavaScript to /collaborate.  

2. Agent Collaboration Loop (Part 6–7, May 29–June 2):  
   - Description: ChatGPT (primary) generates a primary output (e.g., developer_guide_section3.docx), and Grok (secondary) produces a review or alternative (e.g., review.json). Collaboration loops up to 10 cycles, logging each cycle in mas_log.json (e.g., cycle count, outputs). Part 6’s mas_delegate.py delegates tasks (GBP6S5), and Part 7’s consensus_log.py logs outputs in mas_log.json (GBP7S2), with errors in error_log.json (GBP7S4). Output moves to "Ready for Review" state.  
   - Purpose: Facilitates MAS Lite collaboration, producing Atlas PALM v1.5 deliverables and reviews for quality control.  
   - UI/UX: Outputs are logged but not yet user-facing; Part 9’s file viewer will display them.  

3. Human Review (Part 7, 9, June 1–5):  
   - Description: Zachary Lark reviews outputs (e.g., .docx vs. .json) via Part 9’s UI (GBP9S2, June 5), which includes AI-generated commentary preview and an editable final draft. User updates the consensus flag in mas_log.json ("pending" to "approved", GBP7S3) and can prompt AI agents for post-review revision. Errors are checked in error_log.json.  
   - Purpose: Ensures Atlas PALM v1.5 deliverables meet stakeholder requirements (e.g., Developer Guide content) before committing.  
   - UI/UX: File viewer shows .docx/.json files with commentary; user edits draft, clicks to approve/reject consensus, or prompts revision.  

4. Commit to Repository (Part 8, June 3–4):  
   - Description: Approved deliverables are committed to /deliverables/docs using Part 8’s commit_deliverables.py (GBP8S2, S4), logged in Part 4’s log.json (GBP8S3). A summary footer by agents (ChatGPT, Grok) and traceable metadata (who did what, cycle count, AI version, token trace) are appended. The repository structure (/deliverables/docs, /scripts, /configs, GBP8S1) organizes Atlas PALM v1.5 files. Auto-generated Git commit message is presented, editable by user, with manual push via GitHub Desktop or CLI.  
   - Purpose: Stores validated deliverables in Erudite’s GitHub repository, enabling stakeholder access.  
   - UI/UX: User triggers commits via GitHub Desktop or a planned Part 8 UI button (e.g., "Commit Deliverables"), edits commit message, confirms push.  

5. Advanced Automation (Part 20, June 21–23):  
   - Description: Part 20 enhances the lifecycle with autonomous consensus (mas_consensus.py, GBP18S2), negotiation (mas_negotiate.py, GBP18S3), and lifecycle tooling (optimized agent_api.py, GBP20S1). Agent credentialing (e.g., API tokens) secures access, and AI loop control manages iterations (GBP18S1).  
   - Purpose: Makes MAS Lite production-ready for Atlas PALM v1.5, automating repetitive tasks and scaling collaboration.  
   - UI/UX: A task dashboard (planned for Part 20) displays task status (from mas_log.json) and automates commits.
