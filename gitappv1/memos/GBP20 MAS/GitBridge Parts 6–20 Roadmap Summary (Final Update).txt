Parts 6–20 Roadmap Summary: GitBridge Project for 20-Part Master Plan  
Generated on: 01:39 AM PDT, Wednesday, May 28, 2025  

Overview  
This document consolidates Parts 6–20 of the 20-part Master Plan for GitBridge, a platform automating Erudite’s GitHub repository and enabling Multi-Agent System Light (MAS Light) for Atlas PALM v1.5, a cannabis-industry AI tool. Parts 6–20 build on Part 5’s Flask-based API (agent_api.py, index.html), scheduled for completion by May 28, 2025, 11:59 PM PDT (~6h 9m total), to develop MAS Light, test core functionality, and enhance features (e.g., autonomous MAS, Figma visuals) by June 23, 2025. All steps are pending as of May 28, 2025, 01:39 AM PDT, scheduled to start after Part 5 completion and roadmap cleanup (~May 29 AM–PM). Each part includes detailed steps with deeper descriptions to support non-coder Zach and align ChatGPT with the roadmap.  
Updates reflect the MAS Lite Protocol v2.1 (artifact ID: 61ed584e-d30d-40e9-be86-ef2127c49136, updated), incorporating cost management, SHA-validated task IDs, metadata tracing, AgentConnect, system readiness, and future expansion for Atlas PALM v1.5 deliverables (repository, architecture, .docx appendices). Part 6 includes max_cycles, token_budget, and SHA-validated task IDs (12–14h, May 29–May 31). UI/UX enhancements (e.g., side-by-side preview in Part 9, real-time ping in Part 18) and roadmap adjustments (e.g., 3-cycle test loops in Part 7) are incorporated per ChatGPT’s feedback (Return Memo, May 28, 2025, 08:33 PDT). Lukas will own UI/UX evolution, with a spec-ready handoff by Part 10 (June 4, 2025).  

Total Estimated Time for Parts 6–20: ~137–252 hours  
Schedule Timeline: May 29, 2025 – June 23, 2025  

Part 6: Task Delegation with Cursor AI  
Overview: Part 6 enables MAS Light task delegation, creating a Python script (mas_delegate.py) to parse task templates and send tasks via Part 5’s API, logging actions for Atlas PALM v1.5 deliverables (e.g., Developer Guide). It aligns with MAS Lite Protocol v2.1 (Sections III.1, V) by adding max_cycles, token_budget, and SHA-validated task IDs. It consists of 8 steps (GBP6S1–S8), all pending, scheduled post-roadmap cleanup. All commits will tag MAS Lite Protocol v2.1.  
Estimated Time: ~12–14 hours  
Schedule: May 29, 2025, 2:00 PM PDT – May 31, 2025, 1:30 PM PDT  

GBP6S1: Define Task Template (.json)  
- Description/Purpose: Create a JSON task template (e.g., task_template.json) defining fields like task_id (SHA-validated), description (e.g., “Draft Developer Guide Section 3”), assignee (e.g., “ChatGPT”), max_cycles (default 10), and token_budget (e.g., 5000 tokens). This standardizes task assignments for MAS Light, ensuring Grok and ChatGPT can process tasks consistently with resource constraints. Why: Provides a structured format for task delegation, critical for Atlas PALM v1.5 deliverables (e.g., .docx guides), per MAS Lite Protocol v2.1 (Section III.1). How: Use Cursor AI to draft and validate JSON syntax, with Python’s hashlib for SHA validation, guided by ChatGPT for non-coder clarity.  
- Estimated Time: ~1.5 hours  
- Scheduled: May 29, 2025, 2:00 PM–3:30 PM PDT
