I. Executive Summary
The MAS Lite Protocol defines the structure and flow of collaborative task execution between two AI agents 
(e.g., ChatGPT and Grok) under guided human oversight within the GitBridge system. The protocol ensures 
productive iteration, integrity, and traceable accountability from task creation to GitHub integration.

Version 2.0 of this protocol is designed for full implementation in Part 20 of GitBridge and introduces 
assignment lifecycle tooling, agent credentialing, AI loop control, and commit-to-Git automation.

II. Role Definitions
• ChatGPT – Lead drafter, protocol anchor, structure generator, and summarizer.
• Grok – Challenger, logic refiner, alternative path modeler, or appendix contributor.
• Human – Task initiator, oversight reviewer, interaction filter, and commit finalizer.
• GitBridge – Collaboration infrastructure, UI/UX delivery, logging and commit mediator.

III. Assignment Lifecycle (v2.0 Workflow)
1. Task Initialization
   - Assignment Name
   - Agent Selection (Primary, Secondary)
   - Reference Materials (prior sections, uploads)
   - Max Cycles + Token Budget Estimate

2. Agent Collaboration Loop
   - Primary agent drafts
   - Secondary agent responds/refines
   - Loop count enforced (max 10)
   - Output passed to “Ready for Review” state

3. Human Review Gate
   - AI-generated commentary preview
   - Editable or replaceable final draft
   - Optional prompt to AI agents for post-review revision

4. Finalization and Metadata
   - Summary footer by agents
   - Traceable metadata (who did what, how many cycles)

5. Commit and Push
   - Auto-generated Git commit message
   - Human confirm/edit + manual push
   - Synced to GitHub Desktop or CLI

IV. UI/UX Integration Points by GitBridge Part
| Part | UX Integration           | Feature                          |
|------|---------------------------|----------------------------------|
| 16   | Assignment Form (Basic)   | Assignment name, primary agent   |
| 17   | AgentConnect              | Credential Setup                 |
| 18   | System Readiness Panel    | Status check for GitHub, Flask, LLMs |
| 19   | Assignment Review Interface | AI-to-human draft viewer      |
| 20   | Full MAS Orchestration    | Final loop logic, commit sync, metadata append |

V. Cost & Resource Management
- Cloud API token budgeting (OpenAI, xAI, etc.)
- Local compute load (if self-hosted LLMs used)
- Future toggle for "local-only" agents
- Display of estimated token usage

VI. Data Integrity, Version Tracking, and Logs
- SHA-validated task ID system
- Cycle tracking logs
- AI version and token trace in metadata

VII. Future Expansion – MAS v3.0 Preview
- Multi-agent role mapping (4+ agents)
- Task tagging and auto-assignment
- Conflict resolution engine (triage UI)
