Part 5 Summary - Cursor AI Onboarding Guide for GitBridge Project  
Generated on: 01:13 AM PDT, Wednesday, May 28, 2025  

Overview:  
Part 5 of the 20-Part Master Plan focuses on building the core Multi-Agent System (MAS) collaboration system for GitBridge, integrating a Flask API, UI, logging, and deployment. It consists of 10 steps (P5S1 through P5S10). Steps 1–7 are complete as of 04:15 AM PDT, May 27, 2025, and Steps 8–10 are scheduled for May 28, 2025, to be completed by 11:59 PM PDT.  

P5S1: Set Up the Project Structure and GitHub Repository  
- Description/Purpose: Initialize the project directory (erudite-flask-api) on your Mac, create necessary subdirectories (e.g., gitappv1/) and files (e.g., agent_api.py, gitappv1_1b.py), set up a GitHub repository (https://github.com/ZachLark/erudite-ecb-api), and push the initial structure. Purpose: Establish the foundation for the GitBridge project, ensuring version control with GitHub.  
- Actual Time: ~30 minutes  
- Started: 00:06 AM PDT, May 27, 2025  
- Completed: 00:36 AM PDT, May 27, 2025  
- Timestamp: Completed at 00:36 AM PDT, May 27, 2025  

P5S2: Create a Basic Flask App (agent_api.py)  
- Description/Purpose: Create a basic Flask app in agent_api.py with a simple /agent endpoint returning "Agent Interface for GitBridge", ensuring the app runs locally on http://127.0.0.1:10002/. Purpose: Set up the Flask backend to serve as the API foundation for MAS collaboration.  
- Actual Time: ~20 minutes  
- Started: 00:36 AM PDT, May 27, 2025  
- Completed: 00:56 AM PDT, May 27, 2025  
- Timestamp: Completed at 00:56 AM PDT, May 27, 2025  

P5S3: Add the /collaborate Endpoint to Integrate with gitappv1_1b.py  
- Description/Purpose: Add a /collaborate endpoint to agent_api.py that accepts agent_name and task parameters, integrating with gitappv1_1b.py to process collaboration requests (e.g., "Grok completed reviewing commits"). Purpose: Enable MAS collaboration by connecting the Flask API with the GitBridge backend logic.  
- Actual Time: ~25 minutes  
- Started: 00:56 AM PDT, May 27, 2025  
- Completed: 01:21 AM PDT, May 27, 2025  
- Timestamp: Completed at 01:21 AM PDT, May 27, 2025  

P5S4: Install Flask  
- Description/Purpose: Install Flask on your Mac using Python 3.13 (/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.13/bin/python3), verifying the installation by running the Flask app and accessing the /agent endpoint. Purpose: Ensure the Flask framework is installed and functional for API development.  
- Actual Time: ~15 minutes  
- Started: 01:21 AM PDT, May 27, 2025  
- Completed: 01:36 AM PDT, May 27, 2025  
- Timestamp: Completed at 01:36 AM PDT, May 27, 2025  

P5S5: Test the Updated agent_api.py Locally  
- Description/Purpose: Test the /agent and /collaborate endpoints locally using curl commands, validating success cases (e.g., Grok, reviewing commits) and error cases (e.g., missing parameters), then commit and push changes to GitHub. Purpose: Verify the Flask API’s functionality and error handling before adding a UI.  
- Actual Time: ~37 minutes  
- Started: 01:36 AM PDT, May 27, 2025  
- Completed: 02:13 AM PDT, May 27, 2025  
- Timestamp: Completed at 02:13 AM PDT, May 27, 2025  

P5S6: Create a UI Script (index.html) to Interact with the /collaborate Endpoint  
- Description/Purpose: Create index.html with a form to input agent_name and task, and JavaScript to send requests to /collaborate, update agent_api.py to serve the UI at the root endpoint (/), test the UI locally with valid and invalid inputs, and commit/push changes to GitHub. Purpose: Provide a user-friendly interface to interact with the MAS collaboration API.  
- Actual Time: ~55 minutes  
- Started: 02:13 AM PDT, May 27, 2025  
- Completed: 03:08 AM PDT, May 27, 2025  
- Timestamp: Completed at 03:08 AM PDT, May 27, 2025  

P5S7: Add Logging to agent_api.py  
- Description/Purpose: Add logging to agent_api.py to record requests and responses for the /collaborate endpoint, initially attempted file-based logging (app.log) but switched to console logging to avoid permission issues, test the logging with valid and invalid inputs (invalid test bypassed), and commit/push changes to GitHub. Purpose: Enable monitoring and debugging of MAS collaboration interactions.  
- Actual Time: ~67 minutes  
- Started: 03:08 AM PDT, May 27, 2025  
- Completed: 04:15 AM PDT, May 27, 2025  
- Timestamp: Completed at 04:15 AM PDT, May 27, 2025  

P5S8: Test the Integrated System (Simulate MAS Collaboration Workflow)  
- Description/Purpose: Simulate a full MAS collaboration workflow using the UI at http://127.0.0.1:10002/, test multiple agents collaborating on different tasks (e.g., Grok reviewing commits, Zephyr analyzing code), verify API handling and logging, update gitappv1_1b.py if needed. Purpose: Ensure the entire system works cohesively for MAS collaboration.  
- Estimated Time: ~40 minutes  
- Scheduled: May 28, 2025, 10:00 AM PDT – 10:40 AM PDT  

P5S9: Deploy the Flask App to a Hosting Service  
- Description/Purpose: Deploy the Flask app to a free hosting service like Render or Heroku, configure it to run publicly, test the deployed app to ensure the UI and /collaborate endpoint work as expected. Purpose: Make the GitBridge app accessible to external users.  
- Estimated Time: ~50 minutes  
- Scheduled: May 28, 2025, 10:40 AM PDT – 11:30 AM PDT  

P5S10: Finalize Part 5 (Document and Share)  
- Description/Purpose: Document the API in a README.md, including a note about planned updates in Part 6 to add max_cycles, token_budget, and SHA-validated task IDs to the task input form and API, per MAS Lite Protocol v2.1 (Sections III.1, V). Share the project with the Cursor AI community (e.g., post a link to your GitHub repository), optionally add a screenshot or demo video, commit/push final changes. Purpose: Complete Part 5 by documenting, sharing, and aligning with the updated protocol.  
- Estimated Time: ~30 minutes  
- Scheduled: May 28, 2025, 11:30 AM PDT – 12:00 PM PDT  

Total Time for Part 5:  
- Completed Steps (P5S1–P5S7): 249 minutes (~4 hours 9 minutes)  
- Remaining Steps (P5S8–P5S10): 120 minutes (~2 hours)  
- Total: 369 minutes (~6 hours 9 minutes)  

Schedule for Remaining Steps:  
- 10:00 AM PDT – 12:00 PM PDT, May 28, 2025
