Part 7 Summary: Semi-Automatic Consensus for GitBridge Project (Optimized - Norman Fletcher Format)  
Generated on: 01:55 AM PDT, Sunday, June 1, 2025

**Overview**:  
Part 7 of the GitBridge Master Plan focuses on implementing semi-automatic consensus logging across agent outputs using MAS Lite architecture. Outputs from Grok and ChatGPT will be logged, reviewed, and either confirmed or rejected using manual consensus flags. This supports verification of Atlas PALM v1.5 deliverables. Cursor AI accelerates the development while ChatGPT ensures structure and quality.

**Key Deliverables**:
- `mas_log.json` schema for collaboration output logging.
- `consensus_log.py` for structured task result capture.
- Manual consensus logic embedded in the script.
- `mas_error.py` to record exceptions and system errors.
- `error_log.json` and `mas_log.json` populated with test data.
- Codebase committed to GitHub with accurate version history.
- Optional UI interface for task submission via `index.html`.

**Task Schedule (Norman Fletcher Style)**:
- **P7P1S1T1**: Design `mas_log.json` Schema — Estimated Time: 00:30:00
- **P7P2S1T1**: Code `consensus_log.py` to Log Outputs — Estimated Time: 01:00:00
- **P7P3S1T1**: Add Manual Consensus Flag — Estimated Time: 00:30:00
- **P7P4S1T1**: Code `mas_error.py` for Error Logging — Estimated Time: 00:30:00
- **P7P5S1T1**: Test Logging with Sample Outputs — Estimated Time: 01:00:00
- **P7P6S1T1**: Debug Errors and Ensure Pylint Compliance — Estimated Time: 00:30:00
- **P7P7S1T1**: Commit Scripts and Logs to Repository — Estimated Time: 00:30:00
- **P7P8S1T1**: Optional: Add UI Form and JavaScript for Task Submission — Estimated Time: 00:30:00


**Total Estimated Time**: 05:00:00  
**Notes**:
- Steps use the Norman Fletcher format: Phase–Part–Step–Task (e.g., P7P2S1T1).
- Cursor AI will handle draft generation and debugging; ChatGPT will support structure and logic.
- Optional UI tasks may be deferred to Phase 8 if focus is needed on consensus scripts.
