  4. Connection pooling for DB operations
  5. Monitoring and alerting for performance metrics

---

### **How to Use**
- Run the web server: `python app.py`
- Access the dashboard at `/`
- Run performance benchmarks: `python performance_benchmarks.py`
- Review results in `benchmark_results/`
- Switch UI language by updating the language in `accessibility.py` or via UI (future enhancement)
