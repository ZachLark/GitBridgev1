## 🚀 **Installation & Deployment**

### **Package Installation**
```bash
# Install from PyPI (when published)
pip install gitbridge-trust-graph==23.0.0

# Install from local package
pip install dist/gitbridge_trust_graph-23.0.0-py3-none-any.whl

# Install with development dependencies

```

### **Quick Start**
```python
from trust_graph import TrustGraph

# Initialize trust graph
trust_graph = TrustGraph()

# Add agents
trust_graph.add_agent("agent_001")
trust_graph.add_agent("agent_002")

# Update trust relationship
trust_graph.update_trust("agent_001", "agent_002", 0.8, 0.9)

# High-performance mode for bulk operations
trust_graph.set_high_performance_mode(True)
trust_graph.set_auto_save(False)

# Batch updates for maximum performance
updates = [
    ("agent_001", "agent_002", 0.8, 0.9, {}),
    ("agent_002", "agent_003", 0.7, 0.8, {}),
