# Phase 21 (GBP21) – P21P1–P21P5 Summary & Code Review

**Date:** 2025-06-19  
**Author:** GitBridge Development Team  
**Scope:** P21P1–P21P5 (Multi-Agent Collaboration Layer)

---

## Overview
This document summarizes the design, implementation, and code review for the first five parts of Phase 21, which establish the foundation for multi-agent orchestration, task fragmentation, collaborative composition, and shared memory in the GitBridge project.

---

## P21P1 – Multi-Agent Role Assignment Protocol
- **File:** `roles_config.json`
- **Purpose:** Defines all AI agent roles, domains, priorities, and workflow configuration.
- **Highlights:**
  - Comprehensive agent registry (OpenAI, Grok, Cursor, GrokWriter, ChatGPT, Synthesizer)
  - Role-to-domain mapping and priority weights
  - Extensible schema for future agents and roles
- **Review:**
  - JSON structure is clear, modular, and easily extensible
  - Follows Phase/Part/Step/Task schema
  - Ready for dynamic role adjustment in later phases

---

## P21P2 – Task Fragmentation Engine
- **File:** `P21P2_task_fragmenter.py`
- **Purpose:** Parses master tasks into subtasks, matches subtasks to agents by role/domain, and simulates dispatch.
- **Highlights:**
  - Dataclasses for `Subtask` and `TaskFragment`
  - Complexity analysis and fragmentation strategies (simple, structured, comprehensive)
  - Agent assignment logic based on roles, domains, and priorities
  - Routing log export for auditability
- **Test Results:**
  - Simple and complex task test cases pass
  - Assignments and dispatch simulation work as expected
- **Review:**
  - Code is modular, well-documented, and extensible
  - Logging and error handling are robust
  - Ready for webhook or async integration

## P21P3 – Collaborative Composition Pipeline
- **File:** `P21P3_composer.py`
- **Purpose:** Assembles subtask results into unified output, detects/resolves conflicts, and tracks attribution.
- **Highlights:**
  - Dataclasses for `SubtaskResult`, `CompositionResult`, and `ConflictInfo`
  - Conflict detection (factual, logical, contradictory, quality)
  - Multiple composition strategies (hierarchical, sequential, synthetic)
  - Confidence scoring and attribution mapping
- **Test Results:**
  - Test run produces composed output, confidence score, and attribution map
  - Regex bug in contradiction detection fixed
- **Review:**
  - Code is clear, with strong separation of concerns
  - Conflict resolution logic is extensible for future arbitration/learning
  - Well-suited for integration with meta-evaluator and memory layers

---

## P21P5 – Memory Coordination Layer
- **File:** `shared_memory.py`
- **Purpose:** Implements a shared memory graph for agents, with scoped context recall and metadata recording.
- **Highlights:**
  - `MemoryNode` dataclass and `SharedMemoryGraph` class
  - Agent and context indexing for fast recall
  - Node linking for provenance and dependency tracking
  - Export to JSON for audit and replay
- **Test Results:**
  - Nodes added, linked, recalled, and exported successfully
- **Review:**
  - Design is simple, effective, and ready for scaling
  - Supports future memory bundling and context-aware agent workflows

---

## General Code Review Notes
- All modules follow the Phase/Part/Step/Task schema and are well-commented
- Logging is consistent and informative
- Dataclass usage improves clarity and maintainability
- Ready for integration and extension in P21P6–P21P7

---

## Next Steps
- Integration test of P21P1–P21P5 modules
- Proceed to P21P6 (Audit & Visualization) and P21P7 (Cursor Extensions)
- Incorporate feedback and prepare for meta-learning and arbitration logic in later phases
