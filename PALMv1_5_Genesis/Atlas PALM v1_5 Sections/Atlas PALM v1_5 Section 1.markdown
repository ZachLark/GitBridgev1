# I: Platform Architecture

The Atlas PALM v1.5 (Platform Architecture Learning Model) is the structural and behavioral backbone of the Atlas Insight Engine, a cannabis-focused AI platform designed to deliver personalized, mentor-guided insights. Built on a modular, multi-layered architecture, PALM v1.5 empowers users—cast as heroes in their cannabis journey—to explore strains, navigate regulations, and receive emotionally intelligent guidance through natural conversation. This section provides a comprehensive overview of the platform’s six-layer architecture, design principles, technical stack, and system flow, integrating advancements from v1.5 while preserving the narrative coherence and technical depth of v1.0. It serves as a critical reference for developers, including our colleague Chat, ensuring clarity for implementation, integration, and scalability.

## 1.1 Overview of the System Architecture
Atlas PALM v1.5 operates on a six-layer architecture—Input Interpretation, Intent & Journey Mapping, Mentor Matrix, Domain Expertise, Output Composition, and Feedback & Learning—designed for flexibility, scalability, and adaptive intelligence. Each layer handles a distinct aspect of user interaction, from parsing queries to delivering responses and learning from feedback. Compared to v1.0, v1.5 introduces significant enhancements: 
- **JSON Schema Export** for precise input validation, reducing error rates from 5% to <1% (see Appendix C).  
- **Cultural Context Filter** for region-specific, culturally sensitive responses, ensuring 100% regulatory compliance (see Appendix C).  
- **Voice Overlay Integration** for dynamic, personalized mentor tones, boosting user engagement by 15% (see Appendix C).  
- **Simulation Framework** for rigorous edge-case testing, achieving 97.5% accuracy (see Appendix D).  

These advancements enable PALM v1.5 to process 1 million queries daily with 99.9% uptime and 500ms average latency, validated through extensive simulations (Appendix D). The architecture is deployed on xAI’s cloud infrastructure, leveraging a modern technical stack to support web, mobile, and kiosk environments, as detailed in Section IX (Integration) and Appendix E.

## 1.2 Core System Layers
The six layers of PALM v1.5 collaborate to transform raw user queries into actionable, narrative-driven insights, as outlined below:

1. **Input Interpretation**: Acts as the sensory cortex, parsing natural language, detecting sentiment, and tagging entities (e.g., strains, regions) using JSON Schema Export. It validates queries against schemas defined in Appendix C, ensuring structural integrity and supporting multilingual extensibility (e.g., Spanish, French). For example, a query like “strain for anxiety in CA” is tokenized, enriched with metadata, and validated in <300ms.  

2. **Intent & Journey Mapping**: Serves as the navigational intelligence, classifying user intents (e.g., discover, optimize) and mapping them to journey stages (initiation, exploration, immersion, disruption, reflection, integration). The v1.5 Cultural Context Filter adjusts responses for regional compliance (e.g., CBD-only in Japan), detailed in Appendix C. This layer achieves 95% intent accuracy (Appendix D).  

3. **Mentor Matrix & Dynamic Personality Model**: The emotional heart, selecting mentor archetypes (e.g., Sage, Guardian) and interaction modes (e.g., Tour Guide, Sherpa) to deliver personalized guidance. v1.5’s Voice Overlay Integration applies tone profiles (e.g., Jake George’s technical style), defined in Appendix C, enhancing user satisfaction by 90% (Appendix D).  

4. **Domain Expertise**: The knowledge core, housing a 10,000+ strain library, terpene profiles, and real-time regulatory data across 50+ regions, structured as a graph-based ontology (Appendix F). Updated from v1.0, it supports complex queries (e.g., “sativa with limonene, legal in WA”) with 99% data accuracy (Appendix D).  

5. **Output Composition & Conversation Strategy**: Crafts human-like responses, balancing narrative flow, emotional sensitivity, and factual insight. v1.5’s tone modulation ensures consistency, with response schemas in Appendix C. Responses achieve 98% clarity, per user feedback (Appendix D).  

6. **Feedback & Learning**: The adaptive memory system, collecting explicit (ratings), behavioral, and conversational signals to refine guidance. It logs interactions in schemas defined in Appendix C, driving 10% monthly model improvement (Appendix D).  

## 1.3 System Flow
The system flow illustrates how layers interact to process a query and deliver a response, with a feedback loop for continuous learning:
```
User Input → [Input Interpretation] → [Intent & Journey Mapping] → [Mentor Matrix] → [Domain Layer] → [Output Composer] → Response Delivered
↓
Feedback Loop
```
- **Example**: A user submits “best strain for sleep in EU” via the API (Appendix E). The Input layer validates the query (Appendix C), Intent maps it to “optimize” in the “exploration” stage with EU restrictions (Appendix C), Mentor selects a Wellness Coach/Sherpa (Appendix C), Domain retrieves CBD-rich strains (Appendix F), Output composes a response (“Try Harlequin, legal in EU”), and Feedback logs the rating (Appendix C).  
- **Diagram**: [Embedded: `atlas_palm_v1_5_architecture.png`, illustrating layers, data flow, cultural context nodes, and API integration].  

This flow, validated by the Simulation Framework (Appendix D), ensures seamless, context-aware processing, with metrics showing 97.5% accuracy across 1,000+ test cases.

## 1.4 Principles of Design
PALM v1.5 adheres to v1.0’s foundational design principles, refined for v1.5’s global scalability:
- **Modular**: Each layer is independently upgradable, enabling rapid feature integration (e.g., multilingual support).  
- **Composable**: Supports deployment in diverse front-end environments (web, mobile, kiosk), as detailed in Section IX and Appendix E.  
- **Contextual**: Retains session memory and user evolution via Postgres/Redis, with schemas in Appendix C.  
- **Emotionally Intelligent**: Adapts to sentiment and intent, leveraging Voice Overlay Integration (Appendix C).  
- **Narrative-Coherent**: Maintains the user-as-hero narrative across interactions, critical to the Mentor Matrix (Section IV).  

These principles ensure PALM v1.5 is both technically robust and user-centric, aligning with Erudite’s mission to empower cannabis consumers.

## 1.5 Technical Stack
The technical stack supports PALM v1.5’s performance and scalability, building on v1.0’s recommendations with v1.5 optimizations:

const submitQuery = async (query, region, context) => {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.atlas.erudite.ai/v1/query', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer <token>',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ query, region, context })
  });
  return response.json();
};
// Example: submitQuery("strain for sleep", "US", { cultural: "therapeutic", timestamp: "2025-05-04T12:00:00Z" })
```
