# Memo: Correction of "10,000+ Strain Library" to "2000+ Strain Library" in Atlas PALM v1_5 Section 5

**Date**: May 4, 2025  
**To**: Atlas PALM v1_5 Development Team  
**From**: [Your Name or Project Lead]  
**Subject**: Documentation and Correction of Strain Library Reference Error in Section 5 - Domain Expertise Layer  

## Purpose
This memo documents an error in the **Atlas PALM v1_5 Section 5 - Domain Expertise Layer**, where the knowledge base incorrectly referenced a **"10,000+ strain Library"**. The correct figure is **"2000+ strain Library"**, which aligns with industry-standard cannabis strain datasets. This memo provides context for the error, outlines the remedy, and details next steps to ensure accuracy in the project documentation.

## Context of the Error
The **Atlas PALM v1_5** project is a cannabis-industry AI tool, with **Section 5 - Domain Expertise Layer** focusing on specialized knowledge, likely related to cannabis genetics or associated microbial strains. The erroneous reference to a "10,000+ strain Library" was introduced by an **AtlasBuilder assistant** during recent work, likely on the night of May 3, 2025. This figure significantly overstated the strain library size compared to verified industry data, such as:

- **Kannapedia**: A public cannabis and hemp genetic database with 2,241 registered strains.
- **Open Cannabis Project**: Approximately 850 strains.
- **Medicinal Genomics (StrainSEEK)**: Around 1,000 strains.

The "10,000+" figure may have resulted from:
- Misinterpretation of a larger dataset (e.g., the Natural Products Atlas’s ~25,000 compounds or The Cancer Genome Atlas’s ~11,000 cases).
- Extrapolation or aspirational projection of a future library size.
- A typographical or data aggregation error by the AtlasBuilder assistant.

The corrected **"2000+ strain Library"** aligns with Kannapedia’s 2,241 strains and other cannabis datasets, making it an industry-acceptable figure for the Atlas PALM v1_5 knowledge base.

## Remedy Implemented
To address the error, the following corrective actions have been initiated:
1. **Documentation Update**:
   - The reference to "10,000+ strain Library" in **Section 5 - Domain Expertise Layer** will be replaced with **"2000+ strain Library"** across all relevant project materials, including the knowledge base, developer documentation, appendices, and the Knowledge Transfer Document.
2. **Source Validation**:
   - The "2000+ strain Library" is supported by Kannapedia’s 2,241 strains, a primary public dataset for cannabis genetics. Additional datasets (e.g., Open Cannabis Project, Medicinal Genomics) may contribute to this figure if aggregated.
   - The exact source(s) for the 2,000+ figure will be confirmed to ensure traceability.
3. **Error Investigation**:
   - The AtlasBuilder assistant’s output from May 3, 2025, will be reviewed to identify the root cause of the "10,000+" error (e.g., data misinterpretation, script error, or manual input issue).
4. **Preventive Measures**:
   - Workflow checks will be added to the AtlasBuilder process to cross-reference numerical claims against verified datasets (e.g., Kannapedia, NCBI).
   - Automated data aggregation scripts will be audited to prevent similar discrepancies.

## Next Steps
To finalize the correction and ensure the integrity of the Atlas PALM v1_5 knowledge base, the following actions are planned:

1. **Update Documentation**:
   - **Action**: Revise all instances of the strain library reference in the Atlas PALM v1_5 documentation to **"2000+ strain Library"**.
   - **Responsible**: Documentation Lead or Knowledge Base Manager.
   - **Timeline**: Complete by May 6, 2025.
   - **Details**: Ensure consistency across Section 5, developer guides, and related materials. If specific files (e.g., markdown or database entries) are identified, provide targeted updates.

2. **Confirm Source Data**:
   - **Action**: Verify the dataset(s) behind the "2000+ strain Library" (e.g., Kannapedia, proprietary data, or aggregated public datasets).
   - **Responsible**: Data Team or Domain Expertise Lead.
   - **Timeline**: Complete by May 7, 2025.
   - **Details**: Document the source(s) in the knowledge base metadata to ensure traceability. If proprietary data is included, confirm the strain count with the data provider.

3. **Audit AtlasBuilder Output**:
   - **Action**: Review logs or outputs from the AtlasBuilder assistant’s session on May 3, 2025, to pinpoint the error’s origin.
   - **Responsible**: AI Development Team.
   - **Timeline**: Complete by May 8, 2025.
   - **Details**: Identify whether the error stemmed from data misinterpretation, script logic, or manual input. Update AtlasBuilder protocols to prevent recurrence.

4. **Implement Preventive Checks**:
   - **Action**: Add validation steps to the AtlasBuilder workflow to flag numerical discrepancies against industry-standard sources.
   - **Responsible**: AI Development Team.
   - **Timeline**: Complete by May 10, 2025.
   - **Details**: Integrate cross-referencing with databases like Kannapedia or NCBI for strain-related data. Test scripts to ensure accuracy.

5. **Communicate Correction**:
   - **Action**: Notify all team members and relevant stakeholders of the correction to **"2000+ strain Library"**.
   - **Responsible**: Project Lead.
   - **Timeline**: Complete by May 6, 2025.
   - **Details**: Share this memo in the Atlas PALM v1_5 formalization thread. If the error appeared in external materials (e.g., presentations), prepare a brief clarification note.

## Communication Plan
This memo will be shared in the Atlas PALM v1_5 formalization thread to ensure all team members are aligned on the correction. Team leads are requested to review their respective sections for similar errors and report any discrepancies by May 7, 2025. For questions or additional details, contact the Project Lead or Knowledge Base Manager.

## Conclusion
The correction from "10,000+ strain Library" to **"2000+ strain Library"** ensures the Atlas PALM v1_5 knowledge base reflects accurate, industry-standard data, reinforcing the project’s credibility. By implementing the outlined next steps, we will remedy the error, validate the corrected figure, and prevent future inaccuracies. Thank you for your collaboration in firming up Section 5 and advancing the Atlas PALM v1_5 project.
