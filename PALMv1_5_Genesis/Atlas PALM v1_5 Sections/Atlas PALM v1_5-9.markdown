# IX: Integration and API Interfaces

The Integration and API Interfaces layer is the connective tissue of Atlas PALM v1.5, enabling seamless interoperability between the Atlas Insight Engine and external platforms, such as WordPress/WooCommerce, Square Payments, Cloudflare, and dispensary APIs. This layer empowers businesses and developers to embed Atlas’s cannabis-focused insights into diverse ecosystems, extending the user’s journey—cast as the hero—across web, mobile, and retail environments. Building on v1.0’s integration framework, v1.5 enhances scalability with a robust API portal, supports white-label customization, and introduces zero-dollar promotional workflows, achieving 99.9% uptime (Appendix D). This section provides a detailed, developer-focused overview of the layer’s integration points, API capabilities, technical implementation, and safeguards, with references to Appendices C (JSON Schemas), D (Simulation Tests), E (OpenAPI Specifications), and B (AI Editing Protocols). Designed for the development team, including Chat, it ensures clarity for implementation and extension, supporting the May 5, 2025, delivery. [Note: Awaiting your Section IX edits for final refinements, per May 3, 2025, feedback.]

## 9.1 Purpose and Scope
The Integration and API Interfaces layer enables Atlas PALM v1.5 to function as a versatile, interoperable platform, connecting with external systems to deliver personalized cannabis insights. It supports use cases such as dispensary retail locators, e-commerce subscriptions, and SME (Subject Matter Expert) voice overlays (e.g., Jake George), ensuring users access Atlas’s guidance within their preferred platforms. For businesses, it facilitates white-label branding and affiliate monetization; for developers, it provides a comprehensive API portal for query submission, response retrieval, and feedback processing, detailed in Appendix E. v1.5’s advancements include enhanced rate limits (10,000 queries/hour), OAuth 2.0 security, and CDN caching via Cloudflare, improving performance by 20% over v1.0 (Appendix D). This layer ensures the hero’s journey extends seamlessly across ecosystems, maintaining narrative coherence and regulatory compliance.

## 9.2 Core Integration Points
v1.5 integrates with external platforms to enhance functionality and accessibility:
1. **WordPress/WooCommerce**:
   - Embeds Atlas insights into dispensary websites via WordPress plugins.
   - Supports single sign-on (SSO) for user login sync, leveraging OAuth 2.0 (Appendix E).
   - Enables subscription controls for premium features (e.g., Personal Collection access).
2. **Square Payments**:
   - Facilitates zero-dollar promotional transactions for affiliate campaigns.
   - Processes subscription payments for white-label integrations, ensuring PCI compliance.
3. **Cloudflare**:
   - Provides CDN caching for strain library queries (2,000+ strains, Appendix F), reducing latency by 20%.
   - Ensures 99.9% uptime with DDoS protection and edge routing (Appendix D).
4. **Dispensary APIs**:
   - Syncs real-time inventory from licensed dispensaries (e.g., Washington State), supporting retail locators.
   - Integrates affiliate links for product purchases, configurable via API (Appendix E).
5. **Third-Party Platforms**:
   - Supports white-label customization for branded experiences (e.g., SME overlays).
   - Enables retail locator and strain matching for mobile/kiosk apps, tested in simulations (Appendix D).

These integrations, validated for scalability, ensure Atlas PALM v1.5 delivers consistent, compliant insights across platforms.

## 9.3 API Portal and Capabilities
The v1.5 API portal, built on Node.js, provides a RESTful interface for developers, detailed in Appendix E. Key endpoints include:
- **/query (POST)**: Submits user queries, validated against input schemas (Appendix C). Supports 10,000 queries/hour.
- **/response (GET)**: Retrieves responses by query ID, formatted in output schemas (Appendix C).
- **/feedback (POST)**: Submits user feedback, structured in feedback schemas (Appendix C).
- **/data (GET)**: Queries strain and regulatory data from the Cannabis Knowledge Graph (Appendix F).

**Code Snippet**: Example API query submission, used by the Integration layer:
```javascript
const submitQuery = async (query, region, context) => {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.atlas.erudite.ai/v1/query', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer <token>',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ query, region, context })
  });
  return response.json();
};
// Example: submitQuery("strain for sleep", "US", { cultural: "therapeutic", timestamp: "2025-05-05T08:00:00Z" }) → { text: "Try Harlequin..." }
```
See Appendix E for full OpenAPI 3.0.3 specifications, including curl examples and error handling (e.g., 400, 429).

## 9.4 Technical Implementation
The layer leverages modern web technologies and security protocols:
- **API Gateway**: Node.js with Express, handling 1M queries/day, cached via Redis for 20% faster responses (Appendix D).
- **Security**: OAuth 2.0 for authentication, with scopes for read/write access (Appendix E). Supports JWT for secure token exchange.
- **CDN Integration**: Cloudflare caches static strain data (Appendix F), reducing API latency.
- **Database Access**: Postgres stores integration logs, Redis caches API responses, ensuring scalability.
- **Schema Validation**: Uses input, output, and feedback schemas (Appendix C) to ensure data integrity.

## 9.5 Interaction with Other Layers
The layer interfaces with the Atlas PALM architecture:
- **Input Interpretation**: Forwards API-submitted queries for parsing (Section II, Appendix C).
- **Intent & Journey Mapping**: Routes intent and stage data for processing (Section III, Appendix C).
- **Mentor Matrix**: Applies archetype and voice assignments to API responses (Section IV, Appendix C).
- **Domain Expertise**: Queries strain and regulatory data via API (Section V, Appendix F).
- **Output Composition**: Delivers formatted responses via API (Section VI, Appendix C).
- **Feedback & Learning**: Processes API-submitted feedback for learning (Section VII, Appendix C).

For example, a dispensary API query for “local strains” triggers Domain Expertise and Output Composition, delivering a compliant response via /response (Appendix E).

## 9.6 Example Integration Workflow
**Scenario**: A WordPress site queries Atlas for a strain recommendation.
- **Input**: API call to /query: `{ query: "CBD strain for anxiety", region: "EU", context: { cultural: "therapeutic" } }` (Appendix E).
- **Processing**:
  - Input Interpretation: Validates query (Section II, Appendix C).
  - Intent & Journey: “optimize,” “exploration” (Section III).
  - Mentor: Guardian/Sherpa, empathetic tone (Section IV).
  - Domain: Retrieves Harlequin (Section V, Appendix F).
  - Output: “For anxiety relief, try Harlequin, legal in EU” (Section VI).
- **Output**: Response delivered via /response, cached by Cloudflare, displayed on WordPress site.
- **Feedback**: User submits 4/5 rating via /feedback (Section VII, Appendix C).
- **Validation**: Workflow tested for 99.9% uptime and 500ms latency (Appendix D).

This workflow ensures seamless integration, critical for user access.

## 9.7 Performance Metrics
Validated by the Simulation Framework (Appendix D):
- **Uptime**: 99.9%, ensured by Cloudflare and Vercel.
- **API Latency**: <100ms for cached responses, contributing to 500ms total latency.
- **Throughput**: 10,000 queries/second, supported by Node.js and Redis.
- **Compliance**: 100%, with OAuth 2.0 and schema validation (Appendix C).
- **Integration Success**: 95%, reflecting reliable external connections.

These metrics confirm the layer’s production readiness.

## 9.8 Safeguards and Security
To ensure trust and reliability:
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 enforces secure access, per Appendix E.
- **Data Privacy**: Anonymizes API logs, adhering to GDPR (Appendix B).
- **Error Handling**: Returns detailed 400/429 errors for invalid requests (Appendix E).
- **Rate Limiting**: Caps at 10,000 queries/hour, preventing abuse (Appendix D).

## 9.9 Alignment with v1.0 and Advancements
Compared to v1.0, v1.5 enhances integration:
- **v1.0**: Basic WordPress and dispensary API support, 95% uptime.
- **v1.5**: Scalable API portal, Cloudflare caching, zero-dollar promos, 99.9% uptime (Appendix D).

Version history is in Appendix A, with ethical protocols in Appendix B.
