# Table of Appendices

This table provides a comprehensive catalog of the supporting appendices for *Atlas PALM v1.5*, enabling the development team, including Chat, to navigate the technical, operational, and ethical resources underpinning the Atlas Insight Engine. Each appendix is referenced across Sections I–XI, enhancing the platform’s robustness and empowering developers to implement, test, and extend the system. The table below lists each appendix, its title, description, content type, and associated sections, aligning with the user-as-hero narrative by equipping developers to deliver a transformative cannabis exploration experience. All appendices are included in a separate *.docx* document, as specified (May 4, 2025), and maintain consistency with the corrected "2000+ strain library" (memo, May 4, 2025).

| **Appendix** | **Title** | **Description** | **Content Type** | **Associated Sections** |
|--------------|-----------|-----------------|------------------|-------------------------|
| A | Version Logs | Chronicles the version history of Atlas PALM, from v1.0 to v1.5, detailing feature additions, bug fixes, and advancements (e.g., Voice Overlay Integration, Cultural Context Filter). Includes timestamps and contributor notes for traceability. Updated to document the strain library correction (memo, May 4, 2025). | Text/Markdown | I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI |
| B | AI Editing Protocols | Outlines ethical protocols for AI-generated content, including bias mitigation, privacy compliance (GDPR/CCPA), and monthly audit processes. Details bias detection scripts and transparency guidelines, ensuring responses respect user dignity and cultural humility. | Text/Markdown | II, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X |
| C | JSON Schemas | Defines JSON schemas for data validation across layers, including input (query), output (response), feedback, journey, mentor, and domain schemas. Updated for multilingual, voice, and agentic features (Q3 2025, Section XI). Includes validation notes for the 2,000+ strain library. | Text/JSON | II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI |
| D | Simulation Tests | Provides a library of 1,000+ test cases for the Simulation Framework (Section VIII), covering edge cases (e.g., invalid regions), cultural mismatches, and high-volume loads. Includes pytest scripts, results (97.5% accuracy, 100% compliance), and metrics for user satisfaction and latency. | Text/Python | II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI |
| E | OpenAPI Specifications | Details the v1.5 API portal (Node.js, RESTful), including /query, /response, /feedback, /data, /user, and planned /voice_query, /purchase endpoints (Section XI). Provides OpenAPI 3.0.3 specs, curl examples, and error handling (e.g., 400, 429). Supports OAuth 2.0 and e-commerce integrations. | Text/YAML | V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, XI |
| F | Domain Ontology | Defines the Cannabis Knowledge Graph structure (Neo4j-based), covering 2,000+ strains, terpenes, cannabinoids, effects, and regulatory data for 50+ regions. Includes Cypher query examples and data sources (e.g., Kannapedia’s 2,241 strains). Updated for strain library correction (memo, May 4, 2025). | Text/Markdown | V, VIII, IX, XI |

## Notes for Developers
- **Access**: Appendices are housed in a separate *.docx* document, cross-referenced in Sections I–XI for implementation, testing, and debugging.
- **Usage**: Use Appendix C for schema validation, Appendix D for test execution, and Appendix E for API integration. Appendices A, B, and F provide context for versioning, ethics, and domain data.
- **Extensibility**: Appendices C, D, and E are designed for future updates (e.g., multilingual schemas, voice test cases, new API endpoints), supporting Q3 2025–Q4 2026 milestones (Section XI).
- **Consistency**: All appendices reflect the corrected "2000+ strain library" (Appendix F) and adhere to ethical protocols (Appendix B).
